<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nathan Spradley. I'm a new Web Developer. I started getting into coding when I was age 14. I've been 
  coding since then and have learned and been learning new things about coding and web development. I really like doing 
  things on computer. I also like video games, such as Minecraft and Forza Horizon 5, to name a few. I really like coding 
  because 1) it helped me get a highschool credit, 2) because I'm working on a computer, and 3) it lets me help others 
  with their needs in web development.</p>

<p>I also really like cars. I like cars beacuse of their looks, performance, and their speed. I like supercars, to be
  specific. I like Mclarens, and those are my favorite kind of supercars. I like remote control cars, as well. Really 
  just anything to do with cars I will enjoy. Another reason I like cars is for their sound. Especially when it comes 
  to supercars, their noise just sounds so good. The roar of their engines is awesome!</p>


<p>I also like drawing. Drawing is something that I really enjoy beacuse it's calm, and I can take lots of time on it.
  Because I'm homeschooled, I have a lot of time to draw, especially when I'm done with my school work. I like designing 
  things, too. Making up my own creations is really fun, too. Whether in web development, building with legos, and drawing,
  I will always make a great designer. Thank you for reading about me, and I hope you enjoyed my "About Me" page.
